# K-Means-Clustering
In this project, I performed a K-Means clustering analysis to group subdistricts in Semarang City based on the number of health workers, including midwives, pharmacists, and medical staff. The goal was to identify regional patterns and classify areas with similar healthcare capacities to support better resource planning and policy decisions.
