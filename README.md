# K-Means-Clustering
In this project, I performed a K-Means clustering analysis to group subdistricts in Semarang City based on the number of health workers, including midwives, pharmacists, and medical staff. The goal was to identify regional patterns and classify areas with similar healthcare capacities to support better resource planning and policy decisions.

Key Insight:

Most subdistricts in Semarang fall into the cluster with lower healthcare workforce, indicating potential areas for resource strengthening. Meanwhile, a smaller group of subdistricts shows higher healthcare capacity, which can serve as a benchmark for others. These findings can help policymakers prioritize workforce allocation and improve healthcare equity across the city.
